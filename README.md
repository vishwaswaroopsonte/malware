Malware detection and classification using machine learning
Samples from AndroidTrainDataset will be seperated with space and matches with API list if it's present in the list will be kept as 1 else saved as o.
Once the samples and API are organised will be using Feature Selection to compress the data for better perfomance using ExtraTreeClassifier from scikit.
The data will be classified with the Android Label and decide whether the API is malware or not by +1 representing as malware and -1 as Benign.
Used Matplot from creating graphs and compression between algorithms accuracy.
